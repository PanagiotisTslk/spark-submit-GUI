It Describes the development of an Apache Spark microservices management system for the Kubernetes environment, 
which allows users to execute spark-submit commands via a graphical user interface. 

The system addresses the problem of complexity and difficulty associated with executing commands through a terminal, 
providing an innovative and efficient solution. 

Through a web page, users can easily and quickly create and manage Spark tasks, 
improving productivity and reducing the likelihood of errors.

The development of this system contributes to further innovations in the field of automation of complex processes, 
as well as providing the opportunity to expand the management system by adding more functions that will help to facilitate the user.
